## About 💡

In this eccentric project, we dived headfirst into the realm of machine learning to detect strokes. We explored a dataset with attributes like age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and more to unravel the secrets of stroke prediction. Prepare yourself for a thrilling journey through the twists and turns of data analysis and model training! 🎢🔍

## Attribute Details 📝

Let's take a moment to appreciate the eccentric attributes we encountered on this wild ride. Here's a table to showcase the quirkiest details:

| Attribute          | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| id                 | Unique identifier                                    |
| gender             | "Male", "Female", or "Other"                         |
| age                | Age of the patient                                   |
| hypertension       | 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 otherwise |
| heart_disease      | 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 otherwise |
| ever_married       | "No" or "Yes"                                        |
| work_type          | "Children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private", or "Self-employed" |
| Residence_type     | "Rural" or "Urban"                                   |
| avg_glucose_level  | Average glucose level in blood                       |
| bmi                | Body mass index                                      |
| smoking_status     | "Formerly smoked", "Never smoked", "Smokes", or "Unknown" |
| stroke             | 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 otherwise (Class Label) |

These attributes definitely kept us on our toes! 😄

## Algorithms 🧪

To tackle this heart-pounding challenge, we unleashed the power of three incredible algorithms. Hold onto your hats as we introduce them:

1. **Logistic Regression** 📈 - This algorithm slithered its way into our hearts with an accuracy of 95.62%! It knows how to curve those predictions just right.

2. **Decision Tree** 🌳 - With its branching logic, the Decision Tree algorithm wowed us with an accuracy of 91.75%! It definitely knows how to make a calculated choice.

3. **Random Forest** 🌲 - The forest was alive with the sound of accurate predictions! The Random Forest algorithm secured an accuracy of 95.41%. It's like a magical forest full of accurate decisions.

## Results 📊

After an adrenaline-fueled journey through data analysis and model training, we're thrilled to share the final accuracy results of our algorithms:

- Logistic Regression: 95.62% accuracy! 🎉📈
- Decision Tree: 91.75% accuracy! 🌳✨
- Random Forest: 95.41% accuracy! 🌲🔮

These results had our hearts racing with excitement! The algorithms did an impressive job of predicting strokes and left us in awe of their capabilities. 💓💥
